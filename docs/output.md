# nf-core/walkercreek: Output

## Introduction

**nf-core/walkercreek** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline designed for the assembly, classification, and clade assignment of Illumina paired-end influenza data. As of now, this pipeline accepts the influenza modules provided by [IRMA](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/) with "FLU" set as the default module. Future versions plan to support the analysis of other viral pathogens found in [IRMA's](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/) modules, including RSV upon its release.

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## SRA Sequence File Addition

### Extract FASTQ files from optional input file of SRA accessions

</details>

> **Downloading of FASTQ files from input file of SRA accessions using modules .**
* Prefetch sequencing reads in SRA format (`SRATools_PreFetch`)
* Convert the SRA format into one or more compressed FASTQ files (`SRATools_FasterQDump`)

## Sample QC and Preprocessing

### Prepares influenza samples (paired-end FASTQ files) for assembly

</details>

## Assembly, Viral Classification, and Nextclade Variable Gathering

### Assembly and influenza classification

</details>

## Influenza Clade Determination and Analysis

### Nextclade influenza genome analysis

</details>

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

![MultiQC - FastQC adapter content plot](images/mqc_fastqc_adapter.png)

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
